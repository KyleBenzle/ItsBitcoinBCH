True cryptocurrencies suffer from the double-edged sword of decentralization as much as benefit from it. One of the biggest advantages of crypto tokens with centralized developers (BTC) and a small number of large "whale" holders (ETH) is that they have the incentive to promote their investment.

A user of a truly decentralized cryptocurrency has a low incentive to fund development or advertise to others because they will benefit relatively little for the cost. 

One solution to this is a community funded advertising platform where any money donated to an address will be tracked and used directly on advertising for Bitcoin Cash. I hope that someday a process like this could be fully automated wherein users vote for the advertisements to be shown based on how much they've donated to do to the address. Anybody would be able to submit an ad and anyone else can donate to have that ad published.

r/btc - It's Bitcoin, BCH - An experimental advertising campaign for Bitcoin Cash
Right now there is no perfect platform to do this but the website, a - A d s . c o m is set up so that once the ads are submitted it generates a deposit address which is automatically spent to fund the ads. I think given time and effort something like this would be a great option for a Bitcoin cash decentralized organization but for now would be fully dependent on a third party advertising platform.
